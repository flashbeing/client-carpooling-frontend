IT companies need to understand how to best use the data that is made available by different sources.
The NOI Techpark, through the Open Data Hub project, creates and releases, also in collaboration with companies that bring concrete needs, under Open Source license a set of Demo / Beta apps that can be used by individual companies as a guideline and inspiration for new digital products.
