Companies need to give visibility to their data, identify suitable formats, processing algorithms and licenses and use technologies known by application developers.
The NOI Techpark accompanies the customer in identifying which upgrades are necessary for their IT systems and more or less complex processing that can be applied with artificial intelligence algorithms to transform this data into information processed and useful for the end user.

The "basic" product  represents a first analysis on the technological solution to be implemented and specialized accompanying service and is offered free of charge. 

The "premium" product (basic product with data processing processes) can be offered for a fee, depending on the level of complexity of the processing. These costs are incurred by the data provider against the specialized organizations that NOI Techpark proposes to involve for the provision of the service.

Free without SLA.
In case of SLA request, a specific agreement will be evaluated.
