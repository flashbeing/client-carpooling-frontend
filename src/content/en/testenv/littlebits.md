“littleBits is one of the most effective tools in helping students learn basic circuitry concepts.” (Kylie Peppler).
It is a hands-on learning system of electronic building blocks that allows students of all ages to create with technology.
They are easy to use and simple to understand, no prior experience required. Young talents can visit the NOI Techpark and learn about circuits,
we do keep different KITS to explore and to be creative with.
